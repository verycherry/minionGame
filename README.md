# minionGame
This repository contains the code and other files (such as pics) related to a staying alive minion game.

Ideas to implement:
- Get assigned a random minion (show a shuffle through images which ends at final one)
- Add extra actions: feeding, playing, sleeping, ...
- Create a shop to buy play things and food, also maybe things like a house
- Each action (such as feeding) shows a short gif
- Keep track of highscores (number of days alive)
- Show a hyperlink where you can upload your score
- Higher score unlocks things and adds levels - level up shows a gif
- Sometimes randomly you feed something bad and then hungry goes down with 50
